## CV Generator - my third React app - Odin Project

This is my second project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This time I build the same CV generator with functional approach. And added function to add and remove both Practical Experience and Educational Experience.

I also used [Bootstrap React](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for app UI.

The app lets you generate your CV, and you can add multiple Practical Experiences.
